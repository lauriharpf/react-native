# request for change

For 6.0 Making storybook ondevice only. Then 7.0 to add server funcionality maybe.

# 16/11/2020

fixed rerender infinite loop
renamed stories to story store
story id in state to cause sidebar rerender in sidebar and preview without using force rerender

## next time

consolidate the state of the list view and the story view into a single state component or maybe a hook. Hooks don't work, maybe we can fix that.

before next session danny to setup expo web, to make it easier to test changes quickly.

create issues for 6.0 to maybe get more people involved and create visibility also roadmap/project thing.
